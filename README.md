This C program showcases fundamental file handling operations: creating, writing, reading, and appending to a text file. It utilizes standard C library functions to interact with files stored on disk, enabling persistent data storage beyond the program's runtime.
    1. Create and Write to a File: The program opens a file in write mode ("w"), writes two lines of text, and then closes the file.
    2. Read from the File: It reopens the file in read mode ("r"), reads its contents character by character, and displays them.
